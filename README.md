**You do not need to download golang or other dependencies, only docker (docker compose v2.3.3) is required!**
- To download suitable docker compose you need to run **sudo snap docker compose** (from Linux)
- To run application in Docker container:
    - build docker container: **make build**
    - run container: **make run**
    - then go to localhost:10000
    - in case of any spurious errors try to rebuild and run the container again =)
