**You do not need to download golang or other dependencies, only docker is required!**
- To run application in Docker container:
    - build docker container: **make build**
    - run container: **make run**
    - then go to localhost:7000
    - to run an application twice you need to delete .database file and after that to rebuild the container
    - in case of any spurious errors try to rebuild the container again =)
